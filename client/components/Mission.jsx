        From the beginning, our mission has been to organize world&#39;s information
        and make it universally acceptable. Today, people around the world turn to React
        to find information, learn about topics of interest, and make important decisions.
        We consider it a privelege to be able to help. As technology continues to evolve,
        our commitement will always be the same: helping everyone find the information they
        need.
